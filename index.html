                <p>"The extra mile is never crowded" -retired Navy General</p>
                <p>I was born in Exeter NH.  Raised in Brentwood NH and attended Exeter Area High School.  I have a degree in criminal justice and two pending degrees the first in Information Systems and the other general technology.  I have a wonderful wife and three boys that keep me moving almost beyond my ability.  I'm recently looking for work and through a long process of intervieing realized that without coding skills finding employment was going to be difficult.  In order to fix the issue have signed up of the UNH Coding Bootcamp.</p>
